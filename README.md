# **Quote Generator***
### made in JavaScript

## **About the project**

The project:
1. Is **mobile responsive**
2. Involves an **asynchronous fetch request to a rest API** 
3. Has **custom google font** 
4. Uses **font awsome icon**
5. Has ability to **tweet a quote**
 
## **How it works**

The "new quote" button generates a quote. The code includes **an asynchronous fetch request to a rest API** in order to get new quotes.

**The loader** loads between quotes, so when it takes a long time to load, it gives a signal to the user that something is happening behind the scenes.

The Twitter button **opens Twitter in a new tab,** and if you are logged in, it will allow you to tweet using this button.
